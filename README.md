# ML_Project >> Travel Package Purchase Prediction

##  PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  
  Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries and tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry.
Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of purchase of travel packages are of high importance for tourism organizations.
The goal is to predict whether the customer will purchase the travel or not.

  #### APPROACH :
  The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
  
  We need to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and also build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the travel package.
