# ML_Project >> Travel Package Purchase Prediction

##  PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  
  Tourism is one of the most rapidly growing global industries and tourism forecasting is becoming an increasingly important activity in planning and managing the industry.
Because of high fluctuations of tourism demand, accurate predictions of purchase of travel packages are of high importance for tourism organizations.
The goal is to predict whether the customer will purchase the travel or not.

  #### APPROACH :
  The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
  
  We need to analyze the customers' data and information to provide recommendations to the Policy Maker and Marketing Team and also build a model to predict the potential customer who is going to purchase the travel package.

##### 1) DATA COLLECTION AND INSERTION
##### 2) UNDERSTANDING OF DATA
          * Checking for size of data
          * Checking for statistical description of data
          * Checking for data types of columns
          * Value counts for categorical columns
##### 3) DATA - PREPROCESSING
          * Handling of duplicate records and columns 
          * Handling of Null Values
          * Handling of Categorical Data
          * Handling of Numerical Data
          * Handling of Outliers
          * Data Transformation
          * Handling Class Imbalance
##### 4) EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
          * Visualizations of each categorical features

          ### Observation:
              1. **Self Enquiry** is has been done by most of the customers
              2. Most of the Customers are **Salaried and Small Bussiness**.
              3. **Male** customer are **more** than **female** customers
              4. From the Productpitched **Basic** has been taken most wheather **King** very less.
              5. Most of the Customer are **Married**.
              6. Destination of Most of the Customer is **Executive** and **Manager** and Less is **VP**.
